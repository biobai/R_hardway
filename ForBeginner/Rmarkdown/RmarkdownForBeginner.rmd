ipak <- function(pkg){
new.pkg <- pkg[!(pkg %in% installed.packages()[, "Package"])]
if (length(new.pkg))
install.packages(new.pkg, dependencies = TRUE)
}
packages <- c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "reshape2", "RColorBrewer", "scales", "grid", "tidyr", "stringr", "rmarkdown", "xtable", "data.table", "parallel", "devtools", "kableExtra")
ipak(packages)
```

## 1.2 installation of packages need for markdown to pdf.

This step is not nessessary if you don;t use markdown or not wanna to convert it to pdf.

1) download [pandoc](https://code.google.com/archive/p/pandoc/downloads) and install it

2) install tinytex package for windows user, see [instrution](https://community.rstudio.com/t/knit-as-pdf-not-work/15622/6)

```{r packages_letex}
ipak('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
